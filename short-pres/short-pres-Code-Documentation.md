## Basic Ideas of documentation

* Set of media (text, video, images, ...)
* Explaining the USE of a software
* Documentation is for particular users in mind:
	* Machines: persons operating or repairing
	* Software: persons using, developing with, developing in
* Typical role of sense-making: 
	* Developing an app can be done blindly
	* But is done better with a sense of usage (users, their knowledge, their culture, ...)

## Code Documentation

* Normally for others developing the same code
	* experienced dev team
	* newbies that strive to understand
* Tools:
	* code comments
	* ... how in each language?

## API Documentation Generator

- Syntax of particular comments
- Sometimes automatic among classes in IDEs
- Part of the release process: the API doc is one of the "Artifacts"
- Fundamental for API specifications (large audience)
- Referenceability important ("my link should be eternal")

## API Documentation

* Designed for users of others' code:
	* coders but writing other code
	* need to understand what to write as code
	* e.g. all method names, arguments (names, types), classes
* Example: (normally: => HTML pages, IDE presentation)
	*  javadoc (zB [hier](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-io/apidocs/index.html), jsdoc, [typedoc](https://doc.babylonjs.com/typedoc/modules/BABYLON))
	* swagger/OpenAPI (zB [hier](https://ted.europa.eu/api/swagger-ui.html#/))
	* XSDdoc, [owldoc](http://www.biopax.org/owldoc/Level3/), jsonschema2md...
	* for view languages [e.g. example vlddoc](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/faces/4.0/vdldoc/)
	* pydoc (demo with bs4),
